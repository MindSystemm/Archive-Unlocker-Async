This cool can perform async dictionary attacks to unlock RAR &amp; Zip File

# Required depencies

You can add depencies to AdonisUI (design) :arrow_right: https://benruehl.github.io/adonis-ui/
and to DotNetZip (handling zip files) :arrow_right: https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNetZip/
using Nugets packages 

# How does it works? 

Just drag you target (.rar or .zip) into the groupbox and then drag your wordlist to the same place
Then, it's magic :milky_way: , click on start and it'll stop if the password is found. 
It'll use all your cores to create multiple thread to maximize the speed of the tool.
Using 8 threads, it can test 1000 password is minder than 7 seconds
